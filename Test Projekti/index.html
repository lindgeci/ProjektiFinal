                    <h2> Jude Bellingham: England and Real Madrid midfielder wins Golden Boy award.</h2>
                    <p>England and Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham has won the 
                        2023 Golden Boy award - given to the best under-21 player in Europe's top flights.
                    Bellingham, 20, moved from Borussia Dortmund to Real in the summer and has scored 13 goals in 14 appearances.
                        This award comes after he was recognised as the best under-21 player in world football 
                        at the Ballon d'Or ceremony in October.
                        Deep into injury time, he latched onto Luka Modrić’s cross and volleyed a late winner into the net to sink Barcelona and prompt wild celebrations on and off the field.
                        It was Bellingham’s second goal of the game after he had equalized in the 68th minute – receiving the ball outside the box, controlling it with a tap and languidly unleashing a powerful strike into the back of the net.</p>

                    <p>OpenAI, the company behind the viral chatbot ChatGPT, fired its CEO and founder, Sam Altman, on Friday. His stunning departure sent shockwaves through the budding AI industry.
                        The company, in a statement, said an internal investigation found that Altman was not always truthful with the board.

                    <h3>A record number of $50 bills were printed last year. It’s not why you think</h3>
                    <p>
                        Unless you’re an avid currency collector, an employee of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, or work at the Federal Reserve, you likely didn’t know that last year a record number of $50 bills were printed.
                        Last year, the government printed 756,096,000 of those bills — the highest total of the denomination printed in one year in more than 40 years. If you put all those $50s together, you’d have about $37.8 billion. That’s enough to afford Taco Bell’s parent Yum Brands, Inc. $35.3 billion market cap.

                    <p>
                        A torrent of prominent brands halted their advertising on X on Friday, dealing a massive reputational blow to Elon Musk’s social media company after his public embrace this week of an antisemitic conspiracy theory favored by White supremacists.
                        The high-profile advertiser revolt includes some of the world’s largest media companies, such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, Comcast, Lionsgate and Warner Bros.

                    <p>SpaceX’s gargantuan deep-space rocket system, Starship, safely lifted off Saturday morning but ended prematurely with an explosion and a loss of signal.
                        The Super Heavy booster and Starship spacecraft successfully separated after liftoff, as the Starship lit up its engines and pushed away. That process ended up destroying the Super Heavy booster, which erupted into a ball of flames over the Gulf of Mexico. But the Starship spacecraft was able to briefly continue its journey.</p>

                        But it has been worse news elsewhere for Kyiv, after Germany admitted European targets for providing ammunition would fall short.                     
                        Here are the main developments from Ukraine this week.</p>

                        <p>The Israeli military announced a brief suspension on Sunday of “military activities” in the city of Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, for "humanitarian purposes." 

                            The pause took place from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time (3 a.m. to 7 a.m. ET) Sunday, according to an IDF spokesperson. 
                            
                            At the southern part of Rafah city is the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt– the only crossing in and out of Gaza that is not controlled by Israel, making it the sole option for foreigners trying to leave the besieged enclave.</p>

                        <p>The British government is braced for a tricky weekend.
                            Tricky because Rishi Sunak, a prime minister whose grip on power appears to slip at every turn, is a crisis-time leader who seemingly struggles with handling crises.                           
                            On Saturday, the UK will mark Armistice Day – the date commemorating the de-facto end of World War I. Also on Saturday, pro-Palestinian protesters will march through central London demanding a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict. The march will end outside the US embassy in south London.</p>
